Steps to run the demo (run in 2 terminals):

		export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=au_sg_api_channel_sg_endpoint
		python pie.py api.start
		python pie.py test.start
		python pie.py test.subscribe
		python pie.py api.logs

2. Launch AU endpoint (sending side)::

		export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=au_sg_api_channel_au_endpoint
		python pie.py api.start
		python pie.py test.send_message

3. Inspect SG logs to see if there is a received message and callback notification.
